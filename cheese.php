					<h1>Cheese and Wine Quiz</h1>
			
					<p>Every year we organise our Cheese and Wine Quiz night to try to raise lots of money for our nominated charity of the year.</p>
					<p>This year our event was held on Saturday 27th April 2013 at Holyport War Memorial Hall and we packed out the hall with 126 tickets sold.</p>
					<p>The quiz went brilliantly with varied rounds including Music from the ages, First lines from famous books and On this day in history. There were also dingbats puzzles and famous faces on the table to keep our guests scratching their heads between question rounds!</p>
					<p>The quiz was very closely contested and the Maidenhead Rotaract team looked like they were going to accidentally win it at one point! Eventually however a team representing Maidenhead United Football Club managed to secure a well deserved victory.</p>
