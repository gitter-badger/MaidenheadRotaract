					<h1>Fundraising</h1>

					<p>Each year we choose a Charity of the Year that we will support during the coming Rotaract year.</p>
					<p>The charity is normally small and local and we raise money for them at a variety of events ranging from tin-shakes to sponsored sporting events to our own <a href="cheese-and-wine-quiz.php">Cheese and Wine Quiz</a>.</p>
					<p>We are also a registered charity ourselves and our Registered Charity Number is 1051746.</p>
					
					<h3 class="muted">Open Kitchen</h3>
					<p>Our current Charity of the Year is Open Kitchen who are a Maidenhead charity that provide food for the homeless, elderly, disadvantaged and isolated.</p>
					<p>They provide three main services:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Serving Homeless Meals every Thursday evening to around 50 people</li>
						<li>Running Foodshare supplying non-perishable food for people unable to feed their families</li>
						<li>Working with the Salvation Army running the Sandwich Run of soup/sandwiches/fruit on Mondays and Fridays to homeless people sleeping rough on the streets</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For more information visit their website: <a href="http://www.openkitchen.org.uk/">www.openkitchen.org.uk</a></p><br>
	
					<p>In recent years we have also supported:</p>	
					<p><strong>Braywick Heath Nurseries (<a href="http://braywickheath.co.uk" target="_blank" class="maintext">braywickheath.co.uk</a>):</strong></p>
					<p>Braywick run a commercially successful nursery, offering employment and training to people with disabilities or in need of support. We raised over &pound;1,500 for Braywick Heath!</p><br>
					<p><strong>Alexander Devine Children's Hospice Service (<a href="http://www.alexanderdevine.org" target="_blank" class="maintext">www.alexanderdevine.org</a>):</strong></p>
					<p>Alexander Devine fund two community paediatric palliative care nurses who support families across Berkshire in their own homes, providing much needed respite, palliative care, emotional and practical support.</p><br>
